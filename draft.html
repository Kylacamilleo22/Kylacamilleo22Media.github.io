<h2>Dogs or Cats?</h2>
    <details>
    <summary>Dog?</summary>
    <p>If you're an energetic "outdoorsy" type who loves keeping active, a dog may be the right choice for you. Dogs need lots of stimulation, fresh air and regular walks, so they're best suited to people who have a garden, live in rural areas or have easy access to parks and open spaces.</p>
    <p>Well-trained dogs can be taken on trips and enjoy days out and travelling. Unlike cats, they're not naturally solitary animals, so they shouldn't be left alone all day -
         if you work long hours or have a very demanding job, think about whether you can give them the full attention they deserve. You'll also need to set aside time to train them and groom them.</p>
    <p>There are lots of different types of dog breeds available, ranging in size, shape, temperament and hairiness, so you should take these individual differences into account as well if you're thinking about getting a dog. Ultimately, if you have the space and time, you'll be rewarded with a pet who is an empathetic, playful, protective and faithful life-long companion.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Cat?</summary>
        <p>If you have limited indoor space, a busy lifestyle or simply want a more independent pet, you might be better suited to a cat rather than a dog. Cats are relatively quiet and are happy to be left alone to sleep and entertain themselves for most of the day - 
            especially if they're allowed outdoors. They don't need walking, so cats are often well-suited to less active people. They do enjoy social interaction, though, and love being played with. Regular grooming is important too, especially if you have a long-haired cat.</p>
        <p>Cats don't really need as much indoor space as dogs, especially if they have safe access to a garden. Even without outside access, cats can be content as long as they are fed an appropriate diet and have access to a litterbox, toys and scratching posts to keep their minds and bodies busy.
             It's also essential that you interact with them frequently, so if you're going away you will need to find somebody to look after them, which may mean asking a neighbour to check in on them regularly or putting them in a cattery where they'll be looked after while you're gone.</p>
        <p>Although they don't tend to show the boundless energy that dogs do, cats often prove to be more self-sufficient and make loving, affectionate, relaxing and entertaining pets.</p>
        </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Can't Decide?</summary>
    <p>A lot of people love cats and dogs equally, and under the right conditions the two can get along quite happily in the same household if you give them time to get to know each other.</p>
    <p>For more advice on introducing new pets to the fold, see our guides on introducing your dog to other pets or introducing your cat to other pets. If you really can't choose between a cat or dog and are able to offer a good home to both, a puppy and kitten raised together will usually learn to live with each other right away, and may even become the very best of friends!</p>
    
<h3><u>It all depends on you!</u></h3>

<h4>What do I need to start kayaking? How do I paddle? Where's the best birdwatching? </h4>

<p><b>By:Beth Skwarecki</b></p>

<p>To clear your head and get some easy exercise, the only thing that beats walking is getting out on the water. 
    <br>I’m lucky to live close enough to a lake that I can go for a sunset kayak a few days each week, where I watch birds and sometimes just bring a snack, drop an anchor, and float for a little bit.</p>
<p>I finally bought my own kayak a few years back, and I have absolutely zero regrets. 
    <br>It turned kayaking from a thing I did when the weather was good and the rental place was open, to something I can just do anytime. Here’s what you need to know if you’d like to join me.</p>

<h2>Rent a kayak before you buy one</h2>

<p>Before buying a kayak—which is a good option if you know you’ll use it often—it’s smart to rent one a few times. 
    <br> If you don’t have a way to store and transport it, renting may be your only option anyway. 
    <br>(Although there are inflatable and foldable models, but more about those another time.)</p>

<img src="kayak.jpg" width="960" height="540">

<p>A chiller experience is to rent a kayak from a place on a lake and go out for an hour, or whatever you feel like it. 
    <br>Where I live, nearly every state park has a lake, and nearly every lake has a place where you can rent canoes, 
    <br>single and double kayaks, and sometimes an assortment of other watercraft like rowboats, paddleboats, and stand-up paddleboards.</p>

<h2>How do you paddle, anyway?</h2>

<p>Your first time in a kayak, you will be focused on practical considerations like how the hell do I steer this thing. 
    <br>It’s okay if you don’t think any further ahead than that. (Here, by the way, is a video showing you how to steer this thing.)</p>

<iframe width="960" height="540" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rUYEH2cOA7c"></iframe>

<p>A proper paddle stroke uses your core and your lats (upper back) to pull the paddle toward you while you brace your body against the boat. 
    <br>You may also have sore deltoids (shoulders) your first time from the work you’re doing in raising the free end of the paddle out of the water. 
    <br>All told, a hard paddling session is somewhere in between a cardio and a strength workout.</p>

<p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
    <br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
    <br>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
    <br>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
