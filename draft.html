<h4>What do I need to start kayaking? How do I paddle? Where's the best birdwatching? </h4>

<p><b>By:Beth Skwarecki</b></p>

<p>To clear your head and get some easy exercise, the only thing that beats walking is getting out on the water. 
    <br>I’m lucky to live close enough to a lake that I can go for a sunset kayak a few days each week, where I watch birds and sometimes just bring a snack, drop an anchor, and float for a little bit.</p>
<p>I finally bought my own kayak a few years back, and I have absolutely zero regrets. 
    <br>It turned kayaking from a thing I did when the weather was good and the rental place was open, to something I can just do anytime. Here’s what you need to know if you’d like to join me.</p>

<h2>Rent a kayak before you buy one</h2>

<p>Before buying a kayak—which is a good option if you know you’ll use it often—it’s smart to rent one a few times. 
    <br> If you don’t have a way to store and transport it, renting may be your only option anyway. 
    <br>(Although there are inflatable and foldable models, but more about those another time.)</p>

<p>A chiller experience is to rent a kayak from a place on a lake and go out for an hour, or whatever you feel like it. 
    <br>Where I live, nearly every state park has a lake, and nearly every lake has a place where you can rent canoes, 
    <br>single and double kayaks, and sometimes an assortment of other watercraft like rowboats, paddleboats, and stand-up paddleboards.</p>

<h2>How do you paddle, anyway?</h2>

<p>Your first time in a kayak, you will be focused on practical considerations like how the hell do I steer this thing. 
    <br>It’s okay if you don’t think any further ahead than that. (Here, by the way, is a video showing you how to steer this thing.)</p>

<p>A proper paddle stroke uses your core and your lats (upper back) to pull the paddle toward you while you brace your body against the boat. 
    <br>You may also have sore deltoids (shoulders) your first time from the work you’re doing in raising the free end of the paddle out of the water. 
    <br>All told, a hard paddling session is somewhere in between a cardio and a strength workout.</p>

<p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
    <br>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
    <br>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
    <br>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
